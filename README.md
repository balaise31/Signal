An example of using Octave on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/).

This shows you how to make Matlab code that works with [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) run on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/).

The [example notebook](index.ipynb) is taken from the [octave_kernel](https://github.com/Calysto/octave_kernel) repository.
